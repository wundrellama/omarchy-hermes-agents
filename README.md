# Hermes Agents for Omarchy

A standalone replacement for Omarchy's Agents bar widget, adding Hermes usage accounting, provider/model breakdowns, ledger-settling retries, and local/remote gateway source selection. No Omarchy fork, patched system files, global command overrides, or separate daemon required.

**Requires upstream Omarchy Quattro's Quickshell plugin system.** This is not compatible with the older `master` desktop without that system. Developed against `omacom/omarchy` Quattro commit `5b91db503c904bbfc5f34bdaaa9c708814958f3d`.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/wundrellama/omarchy-hermes-agents.git
omarchy plugin enable wundrellama.hermes-agents
```

Review the plugin before enabling it: Omarchy plugins run unsandboxed with your user permissions. The manifest declares `clonedFrom: omarchy.agents`, so enabling it replaces the built-in widget while preserving its placement, settings, and `omarchy.agents` IPC identity. Use the stock Omarchy bar for this integration.

Update through `omarchy plugin update wundrellama.hermes-agents`. To return to the built-in widget:

```bash
omarchy plugin enable omarchy.agents
omarchy plugin remove wundrellama.hermes-agents
```

Removing the plugin does not delete usage records or gateway authentication state. The plugin uses the same state locations as the original Hermes fork, so existing settings and usage carry over. Only one Agents widget should collect usage at a time.

Runtime dependencies are supplied by Quattro: Quickshell, Bash, Python 3 (standard library only), and jq. Node.js is needed only for tests. Helpers remain under the plugin's `bin/` directory and are not added to your PATH.

## Development

Run `./test/all` for collector, gateway-login, source-switching, and plugin-contract regression tests. Tests use isolated temporary homes and a local mock gateway, not your real credentials.

For an unmodified upstream integration check, set `OMARCHY_PATH` to an upstream Quattro checkout and run `./bin/omarchy-agent-usage-update hermes`. This performs a real refresh in your usage state directory. The bundled updater discovers stock collectors under `$OMARCHY_PATH/bin` and adds the bundled Hermes collector; it never invokes or replaces the stock updater. QML resolves bundled helpers relative to the plugin itself, independent of the installation path.

## Attribution

Derived from Omarchy's MIT-licensed Agents widget and wundrellama's Hermes extensions (fork commit `dff0b220a524e47c37f94d1be1b1cf9272de5a3d`). The copied widget, assets, and test infrastructure retain the upstream license in `LICENSE`. This project is an independent extension, not an official Omarchy or Hermes distribution. The widget is maintained here; future changes to the built-in Agents UI are not automatically merged into this copy.

One bar icon and one panel for every AI coding subscription on the machine.
The panel is strictly a display: it watches the usage records that
`omarchy-agent-usage-update` writes to `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`
and draws whatever appears there. `Panel.qml` owns the bar button and the
popup; `Main.qml` discovers and watches the records (and handles the optional
cross-device aggregation); `Agent.qml` is the per-record file watcher.

## Panel

- **Hero** — the mark, the tool, and the plan it runs on ("Max 20x", "Pro").
  Auth and endpoint problems replace the plan line and repeat in a card.
- **Subscription switch** — one chip per enabled agent (`h`/`l` or click).
  It appears only when more than one agent is enabled.
- **Limits** — the percentage of each allowance used, a matching meter, and
  the time until the session or weekly window resets.
- **Balance** — prepaid agents report a credit ledger instead of limits:
  remaining credit, a fuel-gauge meter that drains toward empty, and
  funded-versus-spent detail.
- **Tokens by day** — one row per day for the last week: day, bar, tokens, with today
  bolded at the bottom. Hover today for its prompt and session count.
- **Tokens by model** — tokens per model with the bar behind each row scaled
  to the heaviest model,
  the same way the weekly chart scales to its busiest day. Hover for the
  input / output / cache split.

A subscription appears only when it is enabled in settings and has actually
recorded usage — on this machine or on a synced one. With one such agent
there is no switch row at all; with none, the module leaves the bar entirely
rather than sitting there with nothing to say. A CLI installed mid-session
shows up at the next refresh, so nothing polls the disk waiting for it.

That self-hiding is why the widget ships in the default bar layout: a machine
that has never run an AI coding agent draws nothing, and the icon arrives on
its own the first time a scan finds usage. Drop it with
`omarchy plugin disable wundrellama.hermes-agents`.

## Data

Each agent is one JSON record in `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`,
written by this plugin's bundled `bin/omarchy-agent-usage-update`. That command runs one
`omarchy-agent-usage-<agent>` collector per agent; the widget invokes it
on its refresh timer and whenever you ask for a refresh, and picks up any
record that lands in the directory regardless of who wrote it.

Adding an agent therefore never touches this plugin: ship a collector that
prints the record contract (see the upstream `claude` and `codex` collectors in
`$OMARCHY_PATH/bin/`, or this plugin's Hermes collector), and the panel gains a tab. An `assets/<id>.svg` mark is optional —
with an `assets/<id>-light.svg` twin if the mark needs a dark variant for
light surfaces — and the bar glyph stands in when there is none.

Collectors may include a `modelLabels` object keyed like `modelUsage`, with
`model` and `provider` display strings. The panel uses those source-provided
labels and falls back to formatting the model key when they are absent.

| Collector | Limits | Local stats |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (5-hour session + 7-day weekly) | `~/.claude/projects` transcripts, opencode sessions on an Anthropic provider, plus `stats-cache.json` and `history.jsonl` as fallback |
| `codex` | The Codex app-server RPC | native Codex CLI session files (plus pi and opencode sessions) |
| `fireworks` | Estimated prepaid balance: configured funding minus rated account costs | Fireworks billing API, grouped by day and model for the last 30 days |
| `hermes` | None — Hermes has no unified multi-provider quota | `~/.hermes/state.db` plus named-profile databases, split by billing provider and model |

Claude limits need a signed-in CLI; without credentials the panel says so and
falls back to local stats only. A non-default Claude directory is honored via
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Codex via `CODEX_HOME`. Fireworks reads
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` first, then
`~/.fireworks/auth.ini` (which `firectl set-api-key` creates), then the key
opencode stores in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` when Fireworks is
signed in there.

### Remote gateways

Hermes defaults to **This Computer**, reading its local usage ledger without a
login. The popup's **Usage Source** control can switch to account-wide data
from a **Remote Gateway**, or back to local tracking later. The meter runs only
during the panel's normal refresh and leaves no background process. Enter the
remote URL, username, and password in the popup; the URL is prefilled on later
logins and stored in
`~/.config/omarchy/agent-meter.json`:

```json
{"sources":{"hermes":{"type":"hermes","url":"http://hermes:9119","name":"Hermes","periodDays":365}}}
```

The meter paginates the gateway's existing session-metadata endpoint and
groups its timestamped token counters into this computer's local calendar
days, matching Codex's seven-day layout without requiring gateway changes.
Session titles, previews, prompts, and responses are never written to the
agents panel record.

When authentication expires, use **Remote Gateway Login** in the same popup;
the credentials travel to the meter over stdin and are never command-line
arguments. They stay in `~/.local/state/omarchy/agent-meter/`; nothing is
installed in the gateway application's own configuration directory. If the
remote collection fails, the matching local collector runs instead.

### Fireworks balance

The collector first asks the account's `:getBalance` endpoint for the real
prepaid ledger. That endpoint exists but is permission-gated, and as of
August 2026 no console-issued API key passes it — Fireworks appears to
reserve it for the dashboard session. The probe stays because it is cheap
and the live figure lights up automatically if Fireworks ever opens it to
keys. Until then the collector falls back to estimating the balance from
configuration in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/fireworks.json`:

```json
{
  "accountId": "",
  "fundedAmount": 20,
  "fundedAt": "2026-07-01"
}
```

Set `fundedAmount` to the credits purchased and optionally `fundedAt` to the
purchase date; with no date, the collector uses the account creation time. It
subtracts rated account costs and the panel labels the result as estimated.
For a later top-up, increase `fundedAmount` by the new credit while keeping
the original `fundedAt`, so both the funding and spend still cover the same
period. `accountId` only matters when one API key can access several
accounts. Without a configured `fundedAmount` the tab still shows token
usage, just no balance. With a live ledger, `fundedAmount` is optional and
only adds the meter and the spent-of-funded line under the real figure.

## Interactions

- Bar icon: left = panel, right = launch agent, middle = next subscription.
- Panel: `h`/`l` switch subscription, `j`/`k` scroll, `r` or Enter refresh,
  Tab moves to the neighboring bar panel, Esc closes.
- IPC: `omarchy-shell omarchy.agents <open|close|toggle|refresh|next>`.

## Settings

Settings live in the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The
top-level keys can be set with
`omarchy bar set wundrellama.hermes-agents <key> <value>`:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | `900` | How often the usage records regenerate |
| `syncMode` | `"Off"` | `"On"` writes this machine's snapshot and merges the others |
| `syncDir` | `""` | A folder synced by Syncthing, Dropbox, rsync, … |
| `syncFileName` | `<hostname>.json` | This machine's snapshot file |
| `syncDeviceId` | hostname | Stable device name inside the snapshot |

Numbers need `--json`, or they land in `shell.json` as strings:

```bash
omarchy bar set wundrellama.hermes-agents refreshIntervalSec 300 --json
omarchy bar set wundrellama.hermes-agents syncDir '~/Sync/agent-usage'
```

Per-agent enablement is nested, and `set` writes its key literally rather
than walking a dotted path — so pass the whole `providers` object as JSON (or
edit `shell.json` directly):

```bash
omarchy bar set wundrellama.hermes-agents providers '{
  "claude": { "enabled": true },
  "codex": { "enabled": false },
  "fireworks": { "enabled": true }
}' --json
```

`enabled` defaults to `true` for every discovered agent; set it to `false` to
hide a subscription that is installed. Disabled agents are also skipped when
the records regenerate.

With `syncMode` on, every `*.json` snapshot in `syncDir` is merged, so today,
the last 7 days, and the all-time totals cover every machine you code on —
active days are unioned by date rather than summed. Rate limits stay
per-account and are never merged. A record may declare `"scope": "account"`
when its stats are account-global rather than machine-local (Fireworks'
billing API); those merge by taking the widest value instead of summing, so
the same account synced from two machines is not counted twice.

One caveat on "all-time": the Codex collector only reads native session files
touched in the last 30 days, and Fireworks requests the last 30 days from its
billing API, so their totals and day counts cover that window. Claude's cover
every transcript still on disk.
